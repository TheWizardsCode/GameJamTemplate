# Messy Community Game Jam Team Template

This is a simple template for teams who are going to collaborate on a game jam. All assets are ignored by default and team members will have to install them from the asset store on their local installs. For the last jam we did as a team we used Asset Manager's installed assets tool to sync what assets were installed for the team members. To use the template, create a fork or download the repo and then push back to your repo. You should ideally keep all code modifications in the _Project directory.
